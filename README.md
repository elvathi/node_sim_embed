Abstract:

> In recent years graph embedding techniques have gained significant attention. Modern approaches benefit from the latest language models to encode a graph's vertices in a vector space, while retaining the information involving the structure of the graph.
The exploration of the graph is achieved through random walks, which are then treated as the equivalent of sentences. These approaches, however, do not take into account the similarities between the nodes when implementing these random walks.
In this work, an unsupervised approach for retrieving latent representations of vertices in a graph, is presented. Inspired by traditional community detection algorithms, which compute the similarity between each pair of vertices with respect to some property, the resulting representations not only encode the information about their adjacency in a vector space, but also take into account various similarities between the vertices.
The performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated on the task of multi-label classification, for several artificial and real-world networks. Results show that this methodology outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in networks with strong community structure.
